Drive, iron, chip, and putt your way through a tropical island world, with a few extra tools at your disposal:

**REDIRECTION:** Stop time and turn your velocity on a dime.

**PRECISION:** Send your ball plummeting and it'll stop on impact to land exactly where you want it.

Play through the available 7 courses with these abilities at your fingertips, and golf like you've always dreamed of!
